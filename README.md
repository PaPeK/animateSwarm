[Github](https://github.com/PaPeK/animateSwarm)

## General Notes


## Install

The package depends on a number of basic python packages. Either you can install the provided anaconda environment (see next subsection) or directly install in your current environment (which should automatically install the needed packages via pip).

### Required python packages

The code runs in the anaconda environment specified in `environment.yml` which can be created from the projects root directory via
```shell
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
which creates the environment `animateSwarm` (name specified in `environment.yml`) which you activate by
```shell
conda activate animateSwarm
```
In case you want to update your python packages to enable the code to run the most important packages are:

- numpy
- h5py
- scipy
- matplotlib
- pathlib

### Install in environment

Install locally via running 
```
pip install -e . --user
```
in the root-directory of this package (animateSwarm) where the `setup.py` file is located.
Now you can import the package in your jupyter-notebook or python script via

```python
from animateSwarm import AnimateTools as at
``` 

## Examples 

After you installed the package you can change to the subfolder `examples` and run

```
python AnimateExamples.py
```

which will animate the data from the directory `data` in 3 different animations.

Alternatively you start the ipython-notebook `examples/AnimateExamples.ipynb` and run the cells.
